When having a first one-on-one in a professional capacity, I like to ask the following questions. They provide personal insights into your professional thought process and help create a thriving work environment.

This is a living document, and I will update the questions and answers regularly. Feel free to use these in your own one-on-one conversations.

One of my managers inspired me to start this, and I credit him for introducing me to this concept. These questions are derived from [Lara Hogan's article on the topic](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/).

### Grumpiness

**What makes you grumpy?**

> Unnecessary toil or unclear value in the work being done.

**How will I know when you’re grumpy?**

> I am open about it and will highlight it clearly.

**How can I help you when you’re grumpy?**

> First, let me know if I'm being unreasonable. Second, help me find ways to improve the overall process, even if it's just a small step in the right direction.

### Feedback & Recognition

**How do you like feedback - the medium (IRC, email, in person, etc.)?**

> In person for career development or significant matters. Asynchronously for work or presentation feedback.
>
> I prefer feedback in a structured format, such as the [Feedback Equation](https://larahogan.me/blog/feedback-equation/).

**How do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens?**

> I prefer 1:1s as they allow everyone to be in the prepared state of mind to deliver and receive feedback.
>
> However, this means sometimes valuable feedback in the moment might be lost. Any routine will always be welcome.

**How do you prefer to receive recognition (public or private)?**

> Publicly, as it fosters a culture of mutual recognition.

### Goals and Support

**What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?**

> Understanding what you're working on, what's blocking you, and how I can help you achieve your potential. I also enjoy hearing how you solved a problem and your thought process behind it.

**What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?**

> [Your response here]

**What do you need from your manager?**

> Regular feedback, a sounding board for non-technical ideas, and a mentor to help me improve technically and professionally.

**What do you need from your team?**

> Feedback and open communication to share regular insights.

**What do you need from your peers (outside the team)?**

> A group of professionals who can help each other grow horizontally (technical skills) and vertically (business skills).

### The Wordy Question

**Human learning and growth require the right amount of four things: new challenges, low ego, space to reflect and brainstorm, and timely and clear feedback. How are these four going for you? Is there one you need more or less of?**

> **Low ego:** I like to take on menial tasks as it allows me to learn and improve processes.
>
> **Space to reflect and brainstorm:** I enjoy daily focus time to read new content related to my work and think about problems that need consideration. This varies on a weekly basises for me.
>
> **New challenges:** I stay engaged by seeking new challenges. I notice a lack of engagement on my part when I'm not challenged which is when I try and find new ways to satisfy my appetite for challenges.
>
> **Timely and clear feedback:** I appreciate clear and timely feedback, which my wonderful peers in the past and present have provided.

### The Most Important Question

**What’s your favorite way to treat yourself?**

> I like to buy more tech for my home lab or automation projects.
>
> For bigger celebrations, I enjoy traveling and exploring new places.
