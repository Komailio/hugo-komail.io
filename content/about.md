Greetings! :wave: I'm Komail, and my passion for all things Computers and Electronics knows no bounds! :star2:

Ever since I was 11, tinkering with electronics has been my jam and fervor, and by the age of 13, I was already knee-deep in the world of computers. Though the professional life threw me a curveball and I took an unintentional hiatus from my electronic escapades, I've found my way back to it via personal projects, rekindling the flames of curiosity. :fire:

In the professional realm, I've traversed diverse roles-from Test Automation and Release Engineering to the realms of Site Reliability and Cloud Operations Engineering. My professional journey has been a dynamic exploration, where I've delved into numerous languages and technologies. Yet, amidst this vast sea of knowledge, I find myself navigating most comfortably through the realms of Python, Ansible, Terraform, Backend Development, SQL and NoSQL Databases, RabbitMQ, Docker, and the intricate world of CI. Oh, and let's not forget my adventures with OpenStack, Go, JavaScript, and Kubernetes!

:goggles: :lab_coat: I manage my own home lab, housing numerous services customized to suit my personal requirements. I approach them with the same meticulousness as any production-grade service, albeit with a budget-conscious mindset. After all, there's little sense in fretting over high availability when the home has no power! While I've compiled internal documentation and configurations within my private repositories and internal wiki, I'm excited to begin sharing insights from my home lab on this platform. For a glimpse into my home lab's status and services, feel free to visit my [Status Page](https://status.digimach.com).

## The Genesis of This Blog :bulb:

Ever been bombarded with questions from friends and colleagues about your wizardry? Well, that's been my reality! Often, I found myself hoarding guides and docs in my own internal wiki, accessible only through layers of authentication. But let's face it, subjecting my pals to an identity verification marathon seemed a tad excessive. Hence, the birth of this blog—a virtual treasure trove of my musings and know-how, ripe for the sharing! :books: :brain: :compass:

Moreover, the realization struck that if I didn't have a guide for a particular feat, I'd whip one up and scatter it across platforms like Google Docs—only to promptly forget about its existence! :shrug:

To make this dream a reality, I meticulously classified my personal data, ensuring that everything you stumble upon here falls under the "Public Secure" umbrella. As for my internal code, well, let's just say I've embarked on a grand quest to liberate it, separating the wheat from the chaff in my vast repository of Infrastructure and Configuration as Code endeavors. :rocket:
